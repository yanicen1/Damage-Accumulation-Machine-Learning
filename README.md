# Damage Prediction in Materials with Machine Learning: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Algorithms

This research explores damage accumulation forecasting in materials using advanced machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms. These algorithms leverage acoustic emission signal data collected during the loading of structural materials. For a comprehensive explanation of the methodology, please refer to the "[Damage_Accumulation_ML.ipynb](https://github.com/yanicen1/Damage-Accumulation-Machine-Learning/blob/3e22d51c4c9b4a5c5074ca37fdc958085f817ab3/Damage_Accumulation_ML.ipynb)" file. The libraries utilized in this research are listed in the 'requirements.txt' and 'environment.yaml' files for Conda.
